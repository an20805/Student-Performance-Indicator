# Student Mathematics Performance Perdiction

This is an end to end project, written in **Modular** format to predict the Mathematics score of students through various features. I have made use of various machine learning algorithms such as RandomForestRegressor, LinearRegression, Ridge, Lasso, CatBoostRegressor, XGBRegressor for training achieving an R2 score of **0.88**


## Dataset
The Dataset is taken from kaggle:
